# Learn advance git knowledge

I have some basic understanding of git but still I am not much confident with my git knowledge. There is something which stops me to run difficult git commands. This repository is only for myself to learn advance git knowledge which in turn helps me in multiple development practices.

Topics to be covered in this repository

- Change a commit message.
- Removing changes from the commit (undo commit).
- Move/Copy a commit from branch onto another.
